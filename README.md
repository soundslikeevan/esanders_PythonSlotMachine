# esanders_PythonSlotMachine
A text-based Slot machine built in Python with entry, betting and winnings with two different end points to the game: cashing out or running out of funds.

I did study Python along with my Networking course, though had issues getting my head around a few concepts so decided to follow along with @techwithtim in his Python Slot Machine guide to help my understanding. Tim definitely has a fantastic way of teaching, and I found I knew a lot more than I thought while following along. So please feel free to check out my slot machine!
